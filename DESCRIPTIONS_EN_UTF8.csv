"0000.GRO0091.I","The Moreel triptych represents the essence of Memling's art. It was painted in 1484 for Willem Moreel  a prominent Bruges politician and his wife Barbara van Vlaenderberch née van Hertsvelde. The painting was destined for the Chruch of Saint James in Bruges  where the couple wished eventually to be burried."

"0000.GRO0108.I","The couple portrayed in these panels has been identified from the coat of arms as Jan van Eyewerve and Jacquemyne Buuck. They were married in 1551 or 1552  which makes this painting a wedding portrait. The dog by Jacquemyne's side is a symbol of fidelity. Portraits like these were intended for the sittingroom  where they would be viewed from close quarters. Consequently  they were painted with particular care."

"0000.GRO0110.I","Christ appears in the clouds  his arms outspread  separating the good from the bad for all eternity. The lily and the sword held by the angels at the very top are symbols of salvation and damnation. Pieter Pourbus turns the entire episode into a single dramatic ensemble  with few details to suggest the social rank of the figures and without anecdotal elements like the gates of heaven or the burning mouth of hell. Together these factors make the composition all more imposing."
"0000.GRO0117.I","This Judgement scene was painted for the Council Chamber of Bruges Town Hall. It was intended to remind the city magistrates of their duty to mete out justice impartially."
"0000.GRO0132.I","In this painting  Joseph Suvée recounts the classical myth of the invention of the art of drawing. Dibutades  daughter of the potter Butades  traced her beloved's shadow on the wall of her father's workshop so that she could see him even when he was absent."
"0000.GRO0159.I","Franciscus van der Donckt portrays his niece as a seriouslooking girl. The varied and realistic rendering of materials and attention to detail have always been characteristic of Flemisch art. The refined painting technique is striking even in the work of a less renowned master like van der Donckt. See  for example  the way in which he handles the different fabrics and the hair of the dog."
"0000.GRO0161.I","'Master Joris van der Paele  canon of this church  had this painting made by Johannes van Eyck  painter; and he founded two chantries  to be tended by the canons  1434; the painting was  however  completed in 1436.' So read a latin inscription on the frame.In other words  the canon donated a substantial sum of money to the authorities of ST. Donatian's Church in Bruges to dedicate an annual mass to his memory in perpetuity. The painting will have hung alongside or above the altar at which one of the foundations or chantries was located."

"0000.GRO0184.I","This double portrait of an important man accompanied by his secretary is strongly reminiscent of Thomas Wentworth  Earl of Strafford  with Sir Philip Mainwaring  the celebrated 1640 work by anthony van Dyck. It is also influenced by the art of Italy  where Jacob van Oost spent a number of years."
"0000.GRO0197.I","As a young artist  Florent Willems moved from his native Liège to Paris. He achieved a great deal of success there with his portraits  genre pieces and interiors  most of which he gave a 16th or 17th century feel. Also striking is the skilful way in which he represented expensive fabrics like brocade and silk."
"0000.GRO0204.I","The artist interprets the theme in a very personal way. The vision of heaven above Mary's deathbed  the unearthly colours in the soft  blue light and the enclosed space give this image of the emotionale group of apostles a sens of unreality  as if we were witnessing a dream or delusion. The figures are filled with sorrow and the sens of despair is heightend by the movements of many hands. The composition is structered by the prominent tonalities of the fabrics"
"0000.GRO0208.I","The triptych shows the three main elements of Judgement Day  following a scheme that had been developed by medieval christian thought. The Last Judgement takes place in the middle where Christ appears in the firmament to judge all human beings: the blessed souls are directed towards heaven and the damned towards hell."
"0000.GRO0216.I","These panels were originally the wings of a triptych  the centre panel of which is now lost. The donors appeared on the inside. When the triptych was closed  it showed the image of Death and the Miser. The donors kneel in prayer in a small  enclosed garden. The view in the background includes scenes from the legends of their patron saints Nicholas and Godeliva. Provoost places the episode in Antwerp; the tower we see being constructed is that of the Cathedral of Our Lady."

"0000.GRO0220.I","Only a quarter of the total area was saved from the original topographical map of the castelline of the Brugse Vrije, which Pourbus finished in 1571. The preserved fragment represents the northeastern part of the Brugse Vrije, from Bruges to Zeeland. The identification was done on the basis of the faithful copy (0000.GRO0438.I) that Pieter Claeissens made from the damaged map in 1596-1597. The copy shows us the entire area between the Yser and Westerschelde. As the caption - partly taken from the original map - states, the different cities, villages, hamlets, inns, canals, water dikes, are depicted in separate colors. The map was the largest (23.58 m²) and one of the most accurate of the time. Due to the presence of the arms of the thirty-five crafts and of every congregation or glory, it is also interesting in the heraldic field. This fragment does not only include the most densely inhabited and most complex area of ​​the Brugse Vrije. Moreover, it is the most accurate cartographic document of the late medieval state of the Zwin region."
"0000.GRO0223.I","While Mary suckles her baby  Jospeh is seen in the background giving water to the donkey. Two  other legendary episodes appear further back in the landscape: the Miracle of the Corn and the Casting Down of the Idols."
"0000.GRO0299.I","The Bruges artist Frans Cuyck van Myerop painted these three birds in such a precise trompel'oeil manner as a symbol of the transience and vanity of earthly existence. The genre was very popular in the 17th century. The dead birds recall the fleeting nature of life  while the illusionistic image symbolises the deceptive appearance of the visible world."
"0000.GRO1254.I","These semigrisailles  the figures are presented as statues in a niche  but are not treated as sculptures  originally belonged to a crucifixion triptych  the Triptych of Jan Crabbe. The centre panel is now in the Museo Civico in Vicenza  while the insides of the wings are in the Pierpont Morgan Library  New York."

"0000.GRO1594.I","Before the First World War  Tytgat painted in an Impressionist style  with fluid brushstrokes and delicate colours. He was fond of popular themes like the fair. In the 1920's  by contrast  he developed a highly individual  naïve and spontaneous Expressionism."
"0000.GRO1614.I","The panel is the left wing of a triptych  the central element of which (now lost) was a Virgin of Sorrows. The painting was commissioned by Isabel of Portugal  the wife of Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy. Her patron saint  Elizabeth of Hungary  is shown as a nun holding a stack of three gold crowns  which symbolize her piety  chastity and royal birth."
"0000.GRO1650.I","The artist should not attempt to imitate nature. He should give the image neither the proportions nor the bearing that we ordinarily see  but  on the contrary  that which is expressed by thought and emotion  rather than physical reality."
"0000.GRO1661.I","The scene depicted in this magnificent panaorama is christ wounding with the lace. According to tradition  the blind Roman centurion Longinus pierced the crucified jesus' side with his lace. A drop of blood ran down and splached into his eye  immediately restoring his sight. Meanwhile drakness fell all over the land  th temple curtain was torn in two  the earth shook and the graves opened. The moment is dramatic and is evoced with a great deal of realism. This is an unusual composition  despite of the use of traditional elements  such as the Magdelene embracing the cross  the grieving group on the left and the soldiers playing dice and squabbling on the right. The long  unrury procession of soldiers returning to Jeruzalem links up with the scene on the foreground to form a single meandering ensemble that begings on the left with Saint John and the Vergin. The effect is that of the journee to Calvery in reverse."
"1972.GRO0008.I","When we compare this Mary Magdalene with the painter's Rest on the flight into Egypt we will notice that the latter is still very traditional and Flemish  while this image of the Magdalene has a modern and Italian feel. The classical face and the brown sfumato of the modelling are reminiscent of Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci. By excluding superfluous details  the artist gives Mary Magdalene a classical  serene and even monumental presence."
"1974.GRO0035.I","Luke was one of the four gospelwriters who recounted the life of Christ. According to an earlymedieval legend  he once drew or painted a portrait of the Virgin Mary. The story may have arisen from the fact that Luke wrote in greater detail than the other three Evangelists about Christ's mother. Whatever the case  he was soon adopted as the patron saint of painters  whose guilds and corporations often chose an image of Luke painting the Virgin's portrait to decorate their altars."
"1979.GRO0008.I","The French painter and draughtsman Henri Le Sidaner visited Bruges for the first time in July 1898. He immediately found what he had been looking for: a dreamy atmosphere capable of inspiring symbolically charged and atmospheric paintings. He painted a variety of works in that period  including"
"1980.GRO0030.I","Despite the stylisation and simplifiction in Brusselman's work  we clearly detect the real life and the real nature that it contains. The composition remains strictly geometrical  the outlines of people  animals trees  houses and objects are sharply delineated patches of colour placed within a structured formal pattern. everything is reduced to taut lines  studied forms and colours."
"1981.GRO0001.XI","George Minne owes his reputation primarily to his early sculptures  which he produced before 1900. Medieval art was an important source of inspiration for Minne. This small group of Holy women in mourning dress seems to derive from a Gothic past. The figures recall the pleurants  small weeping figures  that decorate latemedieval mausolea."
"1985.GRO0001.I","A Venetian palazzo appears through the darkness  deep blue and velvety. The image is permeated with the artist's state of mind."
"1985.GRO0033.I","During the 1920s  the period before he embarked on his surrealist adventure  Van den Berghe moved from an extreme and dark expressionism towards a restrained and harmonious art  dominated by robust volumes  warm colours and a mood of serenity  although a sense of unease is never too far away in his work. Village sweethearts dates from this key phase in the artist's career."
"1985.GRO0034.I","Tytgat was a born storyteller and his awareness of narrative is a crucial aspect of his work. The fact that he was a townsman and spent most of his life in the suburbs of Brussels also influenced his imagery. His landscapes are always peopled with human figures. Tygat's paintings recount minor events like the fairground and the circus  but he was also inspired by barbaric and erotic Oriental tales  which he blended with his own  stange fantasies."
"1985.GRO0040.XI","Rik Wouters' last monumental sculpture is an image of his wife Nel. The figure is larger than life and was cast in bronze in a series of twelve. Rik Wouters began as a sculptor before shifting his focus towards drawing and painting. His wife was his favourite model."
"1991.GRO0008.I","The Virgin Mary sits with the Christ Child and the Saints Catherine and Barbara. The knapsack that Joseph carries over his right shoulder suggests that this work depicts an image of the Flight into Egypt. The altarpiece was commissioned by Jan van Cattenbrouck and his wife Jossine Lamsins. Jossine remarried after Jan's death and consequently she had the portrait of her former husband and his patron saint replaced by the portrait of her second husband and his patron saint: Saint Joachim."
"1995.GRO0018.I","This lovely family portrait was painted in 1790 by a Bruges artist who lived and worked in Paris in the turbulent years after the French Revolution. The family Villers is in every way representative of an entire social class in revolutionary France  the character of which is perfectly conveyed in this portrait. The central theme of the painting is fidelity. That virtue is represented in the oval grisaille by a female figure  who strokes a dog while holding the laurel wreath of victory in her other hand."
"2003.GRO0002.I","This painting illustrates the influence that the Flemisch Primitives exerted on their Spanish contemporaries. The hitherto anonymous master was recently identified as Alvaro Sánchez  an artist active in Valadolid within the entourage of the 'Catholic Kings'  Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile."
"2004.GRO0001.I","Eugène Demolder was a close friend of James Ensor. This art critique championed the contraversial artist. Demolder was the first to publish a monograph on Ensor. It was Demolder who was behind Ensor's first oneman exhibition in Brussels. This portrait alludes to the art of the Middle Ages and expresses albeit with Ensor's characteristic irony the late 19th century's renewed appreciation of the Flamish Primitives."
