"132","This work shows the virgin Mary as a heavenly queen with the child Jesus on her lap. They sit on a richly decorated throne supported by cherubs and seraphim. Probably this is the portrait of Agnes Sorel the beloved of Charles VII. She is very fashionably dressed. The high shaved hair and the ermine coat indicate her first name. The constricted waist emphasizes the slightly loosened lapel, revealing the full breast and giving it a slightly erotic tint. The scene is unreal: the milky-white skin of Mary and Jesus contrasts with the bright red and blue angels. The artwork forms the right panel of the so-called Melundipie. The French court painter Jean Fouquet painted this on behalf of Etienne Chevalier treasurer of the French king and husband of Catherine Budé. The work hung above her tomb in the Notre Dame of Melun. The left wing (Gemäldegalerie Berlin) shows Etienne Chevalier with his patron saint Saint Stefan."
"677","In the center is a female figure in a domestic scene. The grandparents sing loudly from a songbook, the father blows powerfully on a bagpipe. The little ones do their best too: the baby sits on mother's lap and blows his rattle whistle, the big brother plays a recorder close to grandfather. The greyhound listens with pricked ears. At the top of the cartouche, one can read the proverb mentioned in the emblem book of Jacob Cats Spiegel van den old en nieuwenijd (1632). It was very popular in the Low Countries of the seventeenth century because of the many references in literature and visual arts. Jacob Jordaens made the first depiction of this proverb (1638). It is literally stated here: the young imitate the elderly. The old man is probably Adam Van Noort's teacher and father-in-law of Jordaens. Perhaps the bagpipe player is Jordaens himself, but that is not very certain."
"1932","Nel, Rik Wouters' wife, looks up from the ironing. Her hands are outstretched, her head up. The painting radiates sun, heat and light. The scene takes place in the artist's home. Everything vibrates in the light, yet many objects are recognizable. For example, there is the basket with the ironing items, the copper lamp, the vase with flowers and the glass stopper on the mantelpiece. They catch the light and reflect it. Wouters does not seem really concerned with the local color, but he does not neglect the shape structure."

"2589","This work is part of pointillism or neo-impressionism. The work is part of a series of eight village scenes (Faits du village) that Van de Velde painted in one month in an artists' colony in the Antwerp Kempen. The townscape is bathed in an internal light that is enhanced by yellow, purple and orange dots. The farmer's wife by the window is enveloped by the light. She wears Flemish peasant clothes, and her figure consists of simple surfaces that indicate her pure and simple existence. It forms the transition element between the spiritual world within the room and the actual material outside world."
"3211","This work is situated in the expressionist period of Gustave Van de Woestyne. The children depicted are Bertha, the helper in the Van de Woestyne family, and Gaston, the so-called brother of the girl who in reality had no brother. They tower above the toy houses and trees next to a dahlia growing out of nowhere. They wear black Sunday clothes and are stock-free in a chair. Their facial features are caricatural."
"5045","In the center are three traders who have their merchandise displayed around them: a young and an old woman in the center and a young poultry trader to the left. The vegetables, fruit and birds are clearly recognizable. Yet this scene does not correspond to reality. The different varieties could never be offered for sale at the same time. Perhaps the painter wanted to emphasize their underlying allegorical significance: many of the fruit and vegetables on display and poultry were considered sensory agents. One can therefore recognize an amorous situation in this scene: the old woman will link the young fruit seller to the young bird dealer. Vogelaar is also a popular name for a woman runner."
"1908-F,"Théodore Géricault is one of the main representatives of French Romanticism. The movement developed a deeplyfelt and individualistic style in reaction to the coolness and strictness of NeoClassicism. 'The Kleptomaniac' was one of the ten portraits made by Géricault of mental patients in the period around 1820. Both in the choice of subjects and in the manner in which they are depicted, this series known as 'Monomaniacs' is as striking as it is exceptional in the history of painting. Géricault does not present the public with 'picturesque' portraits. His depictions are intended as clinical documents. The symptoms of the various 'monomanias' compulsive gambling, kleptomania etc. are apparent from the sitters' garments their facial expressions and their gaze. The suggestive style with its supple and forceful modelling and rapid brushstroke is characteristic of Géricault's late work. The maniacs are certainly not idealised but still their portraits express a certain dignity that presents them as individual human beings. The only exception here is 'The Kleptomaniac'. His appearance is rough and wild mainly because of his tousled hair and unkempt beard. But his most striking feature is his intense gaze which is both fixed and indirect. The mental confusion of this monomaniac is revealed in his eyes. 'The Kleptomaniac' testifies to the typical Romantic search for truthfulness based on careful observation of reality. In this introspective painting Géricault's art reaches its culmination."
"1902-H,"Jheronimus Bosch and his art represent a unique phenomenon in art history. From the medieval language of symbols and imaginative interpretation he forged a highly original vision dominated by religious themes with moralizing messages. As a composition the 'Bearing of the Cross' is as unusual as it is audacious. The picture plane is filled with nothing but heads devoid of volume or spatial effects. Good and Evil are juxtaposed here. The serene faces of Christ and Veronica are points of calm amid the chaos. The grotesque mugs are at once caricatured and lifelike. The expressive types illustrate the corruption and stupidity of mankind. As a study of human facial expressions this work is unparalleled. In its palette technique and iconography it is an apotheosis of Bosch's artistic originality. The "Bearing of the Cross' is not only a unique creation in Bosch's oeuvre but it also stands as a work unlike anything seen in European painting of the period around 1500."
"S-76,"Theodoor Rombouts is one of the earliest and most important representatives of Caravaggism in the Southern Netherlands. In style and subject matter he drew mostly from Bartolomeo Manfredi the most influential figure in the imitation of Caravaggio. Rombouts's oeuvre is characterised by exceptionally monumental genre scenes in a horizontal format. His drinkers card players and musicians 'single figures or groups are painted with strong chiaroscuro contrasts against a neutral dark background. In 'The Five Senses' Rombouts departs from pure Caravaggism. The scene is set in the open air. The varied colour palette great sense of movement and subtle light and dark gradations testify to the influence of the Rubensian aesthetic while the lively expression the convincing rendition of textures the still life and the Manfredian inspiration refer to the Caravaggesque background of Rombouts. This lifesize painting of an animated company of men as an allegory of the five senses is unique in Caravaggist painting."
"1906-R,"Theo Van Rysselberghe was one of the cofounders of 'Les Vingt' and played a major role in progressive art circles of around 1900. His style gradually evolved along with the development of the leading artistic trends around the turn of the century. '' is the major work of Van Rysselberghe's oeuvre. It is a group portrait of his circle of close friends admirers and art critics. Pointillism was developed from Impressionism by the French painter Georges Seurat as a new way of painting in which light is represented by dots of colour. 'The Lecture' was the culmination of the Pointillist tradition in Belgium and a leading example for the intense interaction and exchange between Paris and Brussels artists. It was also both the most ambitious work carried out by Van Rysselberghe in this technique and the last. Van Rysselberghe does not follow the strict stylisation of Seurat but sticks to a realistic representation which enables him to convey the psychology of his models in their portraits. In his application of Pointillist theory to the portrait Van Rysselberghe pushed the boundaries of NeoImpressionism."
"1903-P,"Charles Cottet (1863' 1925) French painter was born at Le PuyenVelay and died in Paris. A famed postimpressionist Cottet is known for his dark evocative painting of rural Brittany and seascapes. He led a school of painters known as the Bande noire or Nubians group (for the somber palette they used in contrast to the brighter postimpressionist paintings) and was friends with such artists as Auguste Rodin."

"1969-B,"James Ensor is one of the most original and bizarre artists in the history of art in Belgium. At the beginning of his career he painted interiors of middleclass citizens known as 'bourgeois salons'. Through the Brussels art circle 'Les Vingt' he was introduced to the irrational Symbolism of the French artist Odilon Redon. The papiermàché carnival masks sold in Ensor's mother's shop were an interesting source of inspiration for developing a highly personal imagery. It is more than likely that this 'Old Lady with Masks' was initially intended as a portrait. Ensor reworked the portrait by adding a multitude of masks that radically changed the atmosphere of the scene. It was shown in 1891 at the exhibition of 'Les Vingt' in Brussels this time with the title 'Le théàtre des masques' or 'Bouquet d'artifice'. This 'Old Lady with Masks' is intriguing on account of the remarkable contrast between the peaceful and gentle expression of the woman and the fearsome and threatening masks that surround her."
"1829-A,"The story of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus comes from the Metamorphoses of Ovidius. The nymph Salmacis fell in love with Hermaphroditus the son of Hermes and Aphrodite. Hermaphroditus rejected her but Salmacis tore him into the water. Still he did not want to know anything about her, and then Salmacis begged the gods to join her with him forever. Both merged into a hermaphrodite, an ambivalent creature with both male and female characteristics. François Joseph Navez painted them just before the metamorphosis. The reserved gesture of Hermaphroditus and the passionate embrace of the enamored nymph form an ingenious and elegant ballet in an almost abstracted line-play. Mythological scenes were rather an exception in the work of Navez. His stay in Rome inspired him throughout his career rather to religious subjects and picturesque Italian scenes. He also achieved great success with his classic portraits."
"1892-A,"The earliest style of Emile Claus was a naturalistic Realism. Under the influence of his Paris contemporaries it soon evolved into Impressionism. Later he adopted Luminism. 'De ijsvogels' ('The Kingfishers' literally 'The Ice Birds' known in English as 'The Skaters') records a crucial moment in this development. With this painting Claus concluded three years of study and created a key work for the history of Belgian Impressionism. He achieved this atmospheric treatment of the wintry light by combining a brilliant technique with a harmonious and luminous colour palette. What makes this painting so impressive is the use of a very clear range of light colours in which only the figures provide soft contrast. Colour and light are the dominant elements in the Luminism of Claus. The acquisition of 'The Skaters' by the Ghent museum was an expression of public support for Claus's new style and the presence of this work in a public collection would also be decisive for the influence of Luminism on the young generation of painters."
"1961-X,"Constant Permeke is the most singular and the most monumental Flemish Expressionist. In contrast to the other Expressionists Permeke made many large drawings. They are typically drawn with great precision and sophistication like this 'Sleeping Peasant'. As a reaction against the 'bourgeois' art of that time Permeke and other artists retired to the village of SintMartensLatem to be more in touch with nature and the rural way of life. In the 'Sleeping Peasant' the artist leaves out every suggestion of place or detail. The enlargement of the peasant's hands and feet enhances the drawing's instinctive expression. By simplifying and distorting the figure Permeke focuses on the essence and the strength of the peasant. The interaction between man and nature is a central theme in his oeuvre. Permeke's art characteristically displays a profound sympathy with the harshness of peasant life and a great connectedness with the earth. With the barest minimum of means in just a few lines he expresses the toughness power and fundamental greatness of the sleeping peasant."
"1898-I,"In the space of a short career Henri Evenepoel created a powerful and highly personal oeuvre in which he managed to arrive at a synthesis of the various Modernist movements of the end of the nineteenth century. 'The Spaniard in Paris' is a portrait of the painter Francesco Iturrino who was a friend of Evenepoel. The monumental and sober figure of the Spaniard is one of the highlights of the history of portraiture. The lifesize figure enveloped in a black cape is standing still in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Paris. In this daring composition the painter depicts the life around the Moulin Rouge on a smaller scale enhancing the majestic and imposing appearance of the Spaniard. Here Evenepoel's feeling for rich and deep colours is demonstrated in the harmony of black blue ochre and the intense red accent of the Moulin Rouge. 'The Spaniard in Paris' was a great breakthrough in Evenepoel's artistic development and greatly contributed to his fame. At the Ghent Salon of 1899 the poet and art critic Emile Verhaeren called the portrait 'an almost perfect masterpiece'."
"1982-E,"Already during his lifetime George Minne enjoyed international recognition in Art Nouveau and Symbolist circles. The 'Fountain with Kneeling Youths' is his most famous and most successful figure group. The slender nude youth is a distinctive creation of Minne's. These fragile and introspective figures are typical of the great poignancy achieved by this artist in his sculptures. The simplicity of line and the ascetic geometric character of this group are characteristic of Minne's nonacademic formal idiom. The repetition of five identical figures around the top of the water basin enhances the expressive force of the whole. The German art critic Julius MeierGraefe judged the 'Fountain of Kneeling Youths' to be 'a perfect ornament' and 'the first sculpture of our new age'. Minne designed the fountain in 1898 and produced different versions in plaster marble and bronze. This version is the only surviving plaster model. The artist kept it in his studio until his death."
"0000.GRO0008.I","The Brussels artist Alphonse Asselberghs was a member of the 'Tervuren School'. He worked not only around Brussels but in the Ardennes the Kempen region and at Barbizon France. Like Hippolyte Boulenger the most important Belgian exponent of landscape painting he worked in a fluid pictorial style with natural earth colours."
"0000.GRO0025.I","In this early work Emile Claus tackles his favourite theme rural life on the banks of the river Lys near Astene in the province of East Flanders. He spent his summers in the area before settling there permanently in 1886. He continued throughout his life to paint sunny images of countrypeople and nature though his style evolved later in the 1890s in the direction of Impressionism."

"0000.GRO0110.I","Christ appears in the clouds his arms outspread separating the good from the bad for all eternity. The lily and the sword held by the angels at the very top are symbols of salvation and damnation. Pieter Pourbus turns the entire episode into a single dramatic ensemble with few details to suggest the social rank of the figures and without anecdotal elements like the gates of heaven or the burning mouth of hell. Together these factors make the composition all more imposing."

"0000.GRO0132.I","In this painting Joseph Suvée recounts the classical myth of the invention of the art of drawing. Dibutades daughter of the potter Butades traced her beloved's shadow on the wall of her father's workshop so that she could see him even when he was absent."
"0000.GRO0159.I","Franciscus van der Donckt portrays his niece as a seriouslooking girl. The varied and realistic rendering of materials and attention to detail have always been characteristic of Flemisch art. The refined painting technique is striking even in the work of a less renowned master like van der Donckt. See for example the way in which he handles the different fabrics and the hair of the dog."

"0000.GRO0184.I","This double portrait of an important man accompanied by his secretary is strongly reminiscent of Thomas Wentworth Earl of Strafford with Sir Philip Mainwaring the celebrated 1640 work by anthony van Dyck.

"0000.GRO0197.I","As a young artist Florent Willems moved from his native Liège to Paris. He achieved a great deal of success there with his portraits genre pieces and interiors most of which he gave a 16th or 17th century feel. Also striking is the skilful way in which he represented expensive fabrics like brocade and silk."
"0000.GRO0204.I","The artist interprets the theme in a very personal way. The vision of heaven above Mary's deathbed the unearthly colours in the soft blue light and the enclosed space give this image of the emotionale group of apostles a sens of unreality as if we were witnessing a dream or delusion. The figures are filled with sorrow and the sens of despair is heightend by the movements of many hands. The composition is structered by the prominent tonalities of the fabrics"

"0000.GRO0220.I","Only a quarter of the total area was saved from the original topographical map of the castelline of the Brugse Vrije, which Pourbus finished in 1571. The preserved fragment represents the northeastern part of the Brugse Vrije, from Bruges to Zeeland. The identification was done on the basis of the faithful copy (0000.GRO0438.I) that Pieter Claeissens made from the damaged map in 1596-1597. The copy shows us the entire area between the Yser and Westerschelde. As the caption - partly taken from the original map - states, the different cities, villages, hamlets, inns, canals, water dikes, are depicted in separate colors. The map was the largest (23.58 m²) and one of the most accurate of the time. Due to the presence of the arms of the thirty-five crafts and of every congregation or glory, it is also interesting in the heraldic field. This fragment does not only include the most densely inhabited and most complex area of the Brugse Vrije. Moreover, it is the most accurate cartographic document of the late medieval state of the Zwin region."

"0000.GRO1614.I","The panel is the left wing of a triptych the central element of which (now lost) was a Virgin of Sorrows. The painting was commissioned by Isabel of Portugal the wife of Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy. Her patron saint Elizabeth of Hungary is shown as a nun holding a stack of three gold crowns which symbolize her piety chastity and royal birth."
"0000.GRO1650.I","The artist should not attempt to imitate nature. He should give the image neither the proportions nor the bearing that we ordinarily see but on the contrary that which is expressed by thought and emotion rather than physical reality."
"0000.GRO1661.I","The scene depicted in this magnificent panaorama is christ wounding with the lace. According to tradition the blind Roman centurion Longinus pierced the crucified jesus' side with his lace. A drop of blood ran down and splached into his eye immediately restoring his sight. Meanwhile drakness fell all over the land th temple curtain was torn in two the earth shook and the graves opened. The moment is dramatic and is evoced with a great deal of realism. This is an unusual composition despite of the use of traditional elements such as the Magdelene embracing the cross the grieving group on the left and the soldiers playing dice and squabbling on the right. The long unrury procession of soldiers returning to Jeruzalem links up with the scene on the foreground to form a single meandering ensemble that begings on the left with Saint John and the Vergin. The effect is that of the journee to Calvery in reverse."
"1972.GRO0008.I","When we compare this Mary Magdalene with the painter's Rest on the flight into Egypt we will notice that the latter is still very traditional and Flemish while this image of the Magdalene has a modern and Italian feel. The classical face and the brown sfumato of the modelling are reminiscent of Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci. By excluding superfluous details the artist gives Mary Magdalene a classical serene and even monumental presence."
"1974.GRO0035.I","Luke was one of the four gospelwriters who recounted the life of Christ. According to an earlymedieval legend he once drew or painted a portrait of the Virgin Mary. The story may have arisen from the fact that Luke wrote in greater detail than the other three Evangelists about Christ's mother.

"1981.GRO0001.XI","George Minne owes his reputation primarily to his early sculptures which he produced before 1900. Medieval art was an important source of inspiration for Minne. This small group of Holy women in mourning dress seems to derive from a Gothic past. The figures recall the pleurants small weeping figures that decorate latemedieval mausolea."

"1985.GRO0033.I","During the 1920s the period before he embarked on his surrealist adventure Van den Berghe moved from an extreme and dark expressionism towards a restrained and harmonious art dominated by robust volumes warm colours and a mood of serenity although a sense of unease is never too far away in his work. Village sweethearts dates from this key phase in the artist's career."
"1985.GRO0034.I","Tytgat was a born storyteller and his awareness of narrative is a crucial aspect of his work. The fact that he was a townsman and spent most of his life in the suburbs of Brussels also influenced his imagery. His landscapes are always peopled with human figures. Tygat's paintings recount minor events like the fairground and the circus but he was also inspired by barbaric and erotic Oriental tales which he blended with his own stange fantasies."

Jossine remarried after Jan's death and consequently she had the portrait of her former husband and his patron saint replaced by the portrait of her second husband and his patron saint: Saint Joachim."
"1995.GRO0018.I","This lovely family portrait was painted in 1790 by a Bruges artist who lived and worked in Paris in the turbulent years after the French Revolution. The family Villers is in every way representative of an entire social class in revolutionary France the character of which is perfectly conveyed in this portrait. The central theme of the painting is fidelity. That virtue is represented in the oval grisaille by a female figure who strokes a dog while holding the laurel wreath of victory in her other hand."
"2003.GRO0002.I","This painting illustrates the influence that the Flemisch Primitives exerted on their Spanish contemporaries.
